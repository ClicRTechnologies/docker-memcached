# Introduction

`Dockerfile` to create a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container image for [Memcached](http://memcached.org/).

## Issues

Before reporting your issue please try updating Docker to the latest version and check if it resolves the issue. Refer to the Docker [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation) for instructions.

SELinux users should try disabling SELinux using the command `setenforce 0` to see if it resolves the issue.

If the above recommendations do not help then [report your issue](../../issues/new) along with the following information:

- Output of the `docker version` and `docker info` commands
- The `docker run` command or `docker-compose.yml` used to start the image. Mask out the sensitive bits.

# Getting started

## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sameersbn/memcached) and is the recommended method of installation.

> **Note**: Builds are also available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/sameersbn/memcached)

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/memcached:1.5.6
```

Alternatively you can build the image yourself.

```bash
docker build -t sameersbn/memcached github.com/sameersbn/docker-memcached
```

## Quickstart

Start Memcached using:

```bash
docker run --name memcached -d --restart=always \
  --publish 11211:11211 \
  sameersbn/memcached:1.5.6
```

*Alternatively, you can use the sample [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file to start the container using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)*

```bash
docker run --name memcached -it --rm \
  --publish 11211:11211 \
  sameersbn/memcached:1.5.6 -h
```

# Maintenance

## Upgrading

To upgrade to newer releases:

  1. Download the updated Docker image:

  ```bash
  docker pull sameersbn/memcached:1.5.6
  ```

  2. Stop the currently running image:

  ```bash
  docker stop memcached
  ```

  3. Remove the stopped container

  ```bash
  docker rm -v memcached
  ```

  4. Start the updated image

  ```bash
  docker run -name memcached -d \
    [OPTIONS] \

```bash
docker exec -it memcached bash
```
